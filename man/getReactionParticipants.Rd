\title{getReactionParticipants returns protein information for a list of reaction ids.
This utility method can help extend information from previous queries.
For instance, if a user queries for reactions related to a list of metabolites,
this method can be used to return proteins on some subset of reaction ids to find related proteins.}
\usage{
getReactionParticipants(db = RaMP(), reactionList = c())
}
\arguments{
\item{db}{a RaMP databse object}

\item{reactionList}{list of reaction ids}
}
\value{
returns a dataframe object with reaction to reaction participant mappings.
