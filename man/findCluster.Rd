\arguments{
\item{fishers_df}{The full result object generated by runCombinedFisherTest}

\item{perc_analyte_overlap}{Minimum overlap for pathways to be considered similar
(Default = 0.5)}

\item{min_pathway_tocluster}{Minimum number of 'similar' pathways required to start
a cluster (medoid) (Default = 3)}

\item{perc_pathway_overlap}{Minimum overlap for clusters to merge (Default = 0.5)}
}
\value{
list:[[1]] Pathway enrichment result with dataframe having a cluster assignment column added
[[2]] analyte type
[[3]] cluster assignment in the list form
