\title{Function that search analytes (gene or compounds)  or a list of analytes and
returns associated pathways}
\usage{
getPathwayFromAnalyte(
  db = RaMP(),
  analytes = "none",
  find_synonym = FALSE,
  NameOrIds = "ids",
  includeRaMPids = FALSE,
  include_smpdb = FALSE,
  min_path_size = 5,
  max_path_size = 150
)
}
\arguments{
\item{db}{a RaMP databse object}

\item{analytes}{a vector of analytes (genes or metabolites) that need to be searched}

\item{find_synonym}{find all synonyms or just return same synonym (T/F)}

\item{NameOrIds}{whether input is "names" or "ids" (default is "ids")}

\item{includeRaMPids}{include internal RaMP identifiers (default is "FALSE")}

\item{include_smpdb}{Include pathways from smpdb/hmdb in analysis. Excluded by default since definitions are highly redundant}

\item{min_path_size}{the minimum number of pathway members (genes and metabolites) to include the pathway in the output (default = 5)}

\item{max_path_size}{the maximum number of pathway memnbers (genes and metaboltes) to include the pathway in the output (default = 150)}
}
\value{
a list contains all metabolites as name and pathway inside.
}
