\usage{
runFisherTest(
  db = RaMP(),
  analytes,
  total_genes = 20000,
  NameOrIds = "ids",
  analyte_type = "metabolites",
  MCall = F,
  alternative = "less",
  min_path_size = 5,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{db}{a RaMP databse object}

\item{analytes}{a vector of analytes (genes or metabolites) that need to be searched}

\item{total_genes}{number of genes analyzed in the experiment (e.g. background) (default is 20000, with assumption that analyte_type is "genes")}

\item{NameOrIds}{whether input is "names" or "ids" (default is "ids", must be the same for analytes and background)}

\item{analyte_type}{"metabolites" or "genes" (default is "metabolites")}

\item{MCall}{T/F if true, all pathways are used for multiple comparison corrections; if false, only pathways covering user analytes will be used (default is "F")}

\item{alternative}{alternative hypothesis test passed on to fisher.test().  Options are two.sided, greater, or less (default is "less")}

\item{min_path_size}{the minimum number of pathway members (genes and metabolites) to include the pathway in the output (default = 5)}

\item{max_path_size}{the maximum number of pathway memnbers (genes and metaboltes) to include the pathway in the output (default = 150)}

\item{background_type}{type of background that is input by the user.  Opions are "database" if user wants all
analytes from the RaMP database will be used; "file", if user wants to input a file with a list of background
analytes; "list", if user wants to input a vector of analyte IDs; "biospecimen", if user wants to specify a
biospecimen type (e.g. blood, adipose tissue, etc.) and have those biospecimen-specific analytes used.  For genes,
only the "database" option is used.}

\item{background}{background to be used for Fisher's tests.  If parameter 'background_type="database"', this parameter
is ignored (default="database"); if parameter 'background_type= "file"', then 'background' should be a file name (with
directory); if 'background_type="list"', then 'background' should be a vector of RaMP IDs; if 'backgroud_type="biospecimen"'
then users should specify one of the following: "Blood", "Adipose tissue", "Heart", "Urine", "Brain", "Liver", "Kidney",
"Saliva", and "Feces"}

\item{pathway_definitions}{If "RaMP" (default), use pathway definitions within RaMP-DB. Else, supply path to gmx file containing custom pathway definitions. GMX files are a tab-separated format that contain one analyte set per column, with the name of the set in the first row, and constituent analytes in subsequent rows}

\item{include_smpdb}{Include pathways from smpdb/hmdb in analysis. Excluded by default since definitions are highly redundant}

\value{
a dataframe with columns containing pathway ID, fisher's p value, user analytes in pathway, and total analytes in pathway
