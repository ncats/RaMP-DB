\title{getAnalyteReactionAssociations returns mets associated with input proteins, and proteins associated with input metabolites
Associations are made through shared Rhea reactions}
\usage{
getRheaAnalyteReactionAssociations(
  db = RaMP(),
  analytes,
  includeRheaRxnDetails = F,
  humanProteins = T
)
}
\arguments{
\item{db}{a RaMP database object}

\item{analytes}{list of analyte ids}

\item{includeRheaRxnDetails}{returns additional columns that inlucdes info in the reaction connecting mets and proteins}

\item{humanProteins}{require reactions to have a human protein (enzyme or transporter), default True}
}
\value{
returns a three dataframes of reaction EC classe information, one for each EC level
