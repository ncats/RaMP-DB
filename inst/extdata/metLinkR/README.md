# Example files for MetLinkR analysis

These files were used for benchmarking the metLinkR package in the [original publication](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12053952/). See the [github repository](https://github.com/ncats/MetLinkR) for more information, including a vignette.

The "manifest" file in this directory (HarmInputFiles.csv) is properly formatted for MetLinkR to analyze the input metabolomics data sets (the other 5 csvs in the directory). MetLinkR recognizes common names, HMDB IDs, KEGG IDs, LIPID MAPS IDs, PubChem IDs, and ChEBI IDs for human metabolites.
